<p>
	This page is a short introduction into the Standalone Aleph Tav.
	There are 612 verses (by my count) that have one of these special type of Aleph Tav's in them.
	One of the features of <b>My Hebrew Bible</b> is that they have been highligted in red <span class="text-danger">את</span>.

<h4>Why a Standalone Aleph Tav List?</h4>
<p>
	In the Hebrew language it is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Hebrew_grammar#Direct_objects" target="_blank">direct object</a>,
	but I believe it <b>points</b> to the Messiah.
</p>

<p>Here is the first occurrence.  It is in the first verse of the bible</p>
<blockquote>
	<div class="hebrew">

	</div>
	<span class="pull-right"><small><cite>Gen 1:1 WLC</cite></small></span>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the first verse of the book of John which I believe is alluding to Gen 1:1</p>
<blockquote>
	<sup>1:1</sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

<h5>Translation Notes</h5>
<p>
	<small>
		The quotes above are from the King James bible with some changes as an attempt to point out the meaning of the <i>Aleph</i> and <i>Tav</i>.
		The changes include of course the addition of the Hebrew letters <i>Aleph Tav</i> which are colored in red.
		<br />
	</small>
</p>
<p>
	<small>
		<b>Rev 1:8""</b> In Rev 1:8 the Greek transliterated word <i>Alpha</i> and <i>Omega</i> is marked up with a strike through and
		the Hebrew equivalent transliteration of <i>Aleph</i> and <i>Tav</i> was appended next to it.
		Both of these sets of letters <i>Alpha</i> and <i>Omega</i> for the Greek and <i>Aleph</i> and <i>Tav</i> for the Hebrew are the first and last letters for their respective languages (in English it would be like A and Z).
		The change in the text was to emphasize the Hebrew roots of <i>Y'shua</i> (Jesus) and his disciple John the Revelator.<br />
		The presumption made is that a Hebrew messiah speaking to a Hebrew prophet did so in the Hebrew language.
	</small>
</p>
<p>
	<small>
		<b>About the picture:</b> The picture of the rock which is found in <i>Kadesh</i> (Num 20) or <i>Meribah-Kadesh</i> (Deu 32:51).
		If you look closely, the letters <i>Aleph</i> and <i>Tav</i> have been embossed and are not found in the original picture.
		Artistic license was employed to express that the rock (<i>Tsur</i>) mentioned in Deu 32 and 1Cor 10:4 had followed them in the desert.
		And it was from this rock that the miracle of the spiritual / living water sprang forth.
		<br />
		The rock (<i>Tsur</i>) is also one of the names for God (<i>Elohim</i> i.e. &quot;&hellip;the Rock (<i>Tsur</i>) of his salvation (<i>yeshuato</i>)&quot; (Deu 32:15).
	</small>
</p>
<p>
	<small>
		<b>Other Notes</b><br />
		&bull;&nbsp; The word for <b>the LORD</b> in Isaiah 53:6 is substituted with the Hebrew word which is spelled <i>Yood Hey Vav Hey</i>.<br />
		&bull;&nbsp; In Rev 1:8, the red letters are found in some version of the King James bible, so those colors therefore were not added.
