	As a final fateful blow to Ephraim, the Northern Kingdom or House of Israel, were to lose their identity as Israel.
	They would become <i>Lo-Ammi</i>, NOT MY PEOPLE.
	They would be stripped of all associations with and memories of the God of Israel and in fact God says He will take from them the things of Torah,
	since they had called the Torah and its instructions a strange thing.

	But God has begun to restore Ephraim’s identity thru the gospel of the Kingdom message that Yeshua preached.
	Ephraim has not known who he is because of a long-term curse put upon him by God.
	The first step back in this process of return is to acknowledge Yeshua as LORD and savior and return to keeping His word.
