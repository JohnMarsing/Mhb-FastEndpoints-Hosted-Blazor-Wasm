	Long ago our forefathers lived in a land beyond the Euphrates River called Mesopotamia.
	There, a descendant of Shem named Abram was told by God to go to a land called Canaan.
	So Abram along with his wife  Sarai and many from Haran journeyed to Canaan.
	There, God told Abraham that He would have many descendants and would live in that land and made an everlasting covenant with him.
	Abram became Abraham.

	Abraham’s grandson Jacob had 12 sons who became the 12 tribes of Israel.
	The 11th son, Joseph, was envied by his brothers, thrown into a pit then sold to slave traders and was brought to Egypt.
	There he  became 2nd in command of all Egypt and in charge of the nations food supply.
	During a great famine, all of Joseph’s family moved down to Egypt.
	Joseph’s purpose for being sold into slavery was shown to him and he revealed himself to his brothers.

	Many years later, the Egyptians began to look upon the people of Jacob/Israel as slaves and made life very difficult for them.
	Then they cried out to God for deliverance.
	They remembered Abraham and the promises that God gave him and they prayed in desperation for a deliverer who would rescue them from their oppression.

	God sent Moses, a Levite, and in a burning bush told him to confront the Pharaoh to <b>Let my people go</b>.
	Pharaoh ignored Moses’ plea’s, so God caused 10 plagues to destroy Egypt.
	The 10th plague, the death of the firstborn, finally caused Pharaoh to let them go.
	In preparation for this last plague, God told the Israelites to choose a spotless lamb one year old.
	Four days later they would kill the lamb and put some of its blood on the doorposts of their homes and eat the roasted lamb with bitter herbs and unleavened bread.
	And they were not to leave any of it until morning, and what remains of it until morning you are to burn with fire.
	This meal was eaten in a hurry with their sandals on and their bags packed and ready to leave Egypt.
	They were ready for the tenth and final judgment, the death of all the firstborn in Egypt.

	And it came to  pass at midnight, all the firstborn in the land of Egypt died, even the cattle.
	<mark>
		“But when I see the blood on the lintel and doorposts of the houses where you live,
		I will pass over you and no plague will befall you to destroy you and you will be spared”
	</mark>.
	Without the death of the lamb and the spreading of its blood, the children of Israel would have suffered the judgment of God.

	The Israelites left Egypt and were led by a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night to a camp on a sandy shore on an arm of the Red Sea.
	Back in Egypt, Pharaoh changed his mind again and took horses and chariots to chase after the Israelites.
	Seeing the Egyptians coming, the people were terrified. Moses told the people,
	“do not be afraid, stand firm and see the deliverance of the Yehovah today. The Egyptians you see today, you will never see again. Yehovah will fight for you.”

	Then God said to Moses,
	“Raise your staff and stretch out your arm over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.”
	Then the sea drew back and dry land appeared.
	The Israelites went through the sea on dry ground with a wall of water to the left and to the right.
	The Egyptians chased after them and followed them into the sea.
	And God caused the wheels on the chariots to come off and threw the Egyptian army into confusion.
	And the Egyptians said,
	“Let us get away from the Israelites because God is fighting for them.”

	Then God said to Moses,
	“Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians.”
	And God swept them all under the sea.
	Not one of them survived.
	That day God saved his people and the people saw the great power of Yehovah our GOD.
	The people feared the Yehovah and put their trust in Him and Moses his servant.
