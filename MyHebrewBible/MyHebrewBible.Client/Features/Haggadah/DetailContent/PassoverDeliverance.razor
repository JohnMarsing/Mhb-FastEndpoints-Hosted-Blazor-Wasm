	Yehovah brought Yisrael out,
	led them through the wilderness, revealed His Presence at Mount Sinai, and gave to them the Torah.
	He instructed them to build the Tabernacle and established a Priesthood to serve Him.
	Neither their shoes nor their clothes were worn out.
	He fed them with manna, gave them water from the Rock,
	defeated their enemies before them and brought them into <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.
	Yehovah did what He promised to do; He delivered them.

	He will ALSO do what He has promised to do to deliver the House of Israel from its dilemma in the nations.
