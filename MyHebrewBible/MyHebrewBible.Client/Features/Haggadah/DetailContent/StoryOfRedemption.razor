	Many years after the children of Israel entered the Land promised to them in the covenant with Abraham,
	the tribes of Israel were in turmoil and conflict with each other.
	A portion of the tribes from the north were called The House of Israel and led by the tribe of Ephraim, the tribe of Joseph’s son.
	The southern tribes were called The House of Judah.
	From this is where we get the term Jews.

<p class="@H.pClass">
	@H.Reader("Reader", 2)
	The northern  tribes separated from their brothers in the south and were led down a path of rebellion by Jeroboam, a king from the tribe of Ephraim.
	They quickly descended into idolatry and apostasy  and built  altars in Dan and Bethel to replace Jerusalem and created a false priesthood to go with their idol worship.
	They even made golden calves and lifted them up as gods to the people like the incident at Mt.Sinai.

	We weep for the bitterness our ancestors felt as they experienced anger and rejection from Judah and throughout their years of rebellion against God.
	It must have been an increasingly lonely existence for them as they plunged themselves more deeply into spiritual darkness and distress.
	They had no way to be set-free as they had rejected the path of freedom that God had given them in His Torah.

	Blessed are You Yehovah our Elohim, King of the universe,

	So God had a plan to use the rebellious House of Israel to redeem the world by sowing them into the nations.
	Yehovah divorced them and cast them out of the Land and they were stripped of their identity and memory of ever having been part of Israel.

	The fate of Ephraim was to not be a people any longer and not be betrothed to Yehovah.
	The first sign of the redemption of the House of Israel from the nations where they had been banished and sifted is with the promise of a Renewed covenant

	Yeshua, the Messiah of Israel,  would come and walk among the people as a man and initiate the return of Ephraim by cutting a Renewed Covenant by His own blood to redeem the House of Israel and The House of Judah because they had broken the old marriage covenant.
	It would be a new MARRIAGE covenant and His resurrection would allow Him to remarry the divorced House of Israel.
	This is the gospel of the Kingdom, God’s master plan to rescue and redeem Ephraim from the nations and restore the broken bride of Israel.
