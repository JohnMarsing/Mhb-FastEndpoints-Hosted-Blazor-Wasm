	The word of Yehovah came again to me saying,

	<sup class="@H.VerseSupClass">16</sup>
	Now as for you, son of man, take for yourself one stick and write on it, ‘For Judah and for the sons of Israel, his companions’;
	then take another stick and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and all the house of Israel, his companions.’

	<sup class="@H.VerseSupClass">17</sup>
	Then draw them together for yourself one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.

	<sup class="@H.VerseSupClass">18</sup>
	And when the sons of your people speak to you saying, ‘Will you not declare to us what you mean by these?’

	<sup class="@H.VerseSupClass">19</sup>
	say to them, ‘Thus says Master Yehovah, Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his companions;
	and I will put them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in My hand.”’

	<sup class="@H.VerseSupClass">20</sup>
	And the sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.

	<sup class="@H.VerseSupClass">21</sup>
	And speak to them, ‘Thus says Master Yehovah, “Behold, I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations where they have gone,
	and I will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land;

	<sup class="@H.VerseSupClass">22</sup>
	and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king will be king for all of them;
	and they will no longer be two nations and no longer be divided into two kingdoms.

	<sup class="@H.VerseSupClass">23</sup>
	They also will no longer defile themselves with their idols or with their detestable things or with any of their transgressions;
	but I will save them from all their places of habitation in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them. And they will be My people, and I will be their God.
