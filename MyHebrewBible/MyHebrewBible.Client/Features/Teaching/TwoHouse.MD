<h2>Review - Notes from Tuesday March 27, 2018</h2>
<h4>Great dialog between myself and Paul Hebron</h4>
<p>
	We finished the <b>Verse List</b> and we spent a lot of time talking about <em>Middle Wall of Partition Broken Down</em> <b>Ephesians 2:12-19</b>
	and Paul Hebron (Paul H) challenged me why that would be a good verse to try to convince a Gentile of the two house teaching.
	This was good because he had good points and <em>Iron sharpens Iron</em>.
</p>

<p>
	Before I go forward with my response, I want to comment on a few verses that we also read that ended up being interconnected
</p>
<p>
	The verses I would like to discuss (review) are...
	<ul>
		<li><b>2 Timothy 2:15</b> Study to show thyself approved</li>
		<li><b>2 Peter 3:16-17</b> "...are some things [of Paul's Epistles] [that are] hard to be understood..."  This isn't on my list, but we did discuss it.</li>
		<li><b>1 Peter 2:9-10</b> chosen generation, royal priesthood, holy nation (quote Hosea ch 1)</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<p>
	My response to Paul H was ...
	<ul>
		<li>
			Choosing those verse in Ephesians for sure wouldn't be a good first verse to lead with because Paul (of Tarsus) is talking allegorically without any direct reference to verses from in the OT.
			An untrained person, who has been feed a bunch of teachings that aren't grounded in scripture (like from Antinomian Christianity) could, in fact, reasonaly dismiss my interpretation.
		</li>
		<li>
			We went back and forth and I realized that even though they were not only powerful verses (with a lot of powerful legal concepts) I couldn't really argue that an untrained person could dismiss these things.
			So we left the discussion there and went on with our list which was <b>2Ti 2:15</b> "Study to show thyself approved"
		</li>
		<li>
			This verse isn't directly Two House but it's great verse for emphasizing that it's your responsibility to <em>study to show thyself approved unto </em> and <b>not</b> that of a self proclaimed religious person.
			It also speaks of a 1) workman for God, 2) unashamed of his work and 3) who can <em>rightly divide the word</em>.
			If Peter is correct that Paul does speak of <em>hard things to understand</em>, then it's reasonable that Paul, in his epistle to Timothy, is encouraging him to know his stuff and study it diligently.
			I see Paul speaking of the law which may be heard to understand, but if you spend the time figuring it out, it becomes extremely powerful.
		</li>
		<li>
			The next verse was <b>1 Peter 2:9-10</b> which speaks of a royal priesthood, holy nation
		</li>
		<li>
			Two House is a means to an end which is to be in covenant with YHVH.
			Two House is however a biblical and historical reality that needs to be dealt with to the goal of being in covenant.
			This point is a good segue to a deeper discussion of Covenants (see Lesson #2).
		</li>
		<li><b>ToDo</b>: expand on my point of bringing these verses up and connecting them to Eph 2.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	Final thoughts, I thought it was neat how the remaining few verses that were originally meant for just Two House tied themselves together and that it would help to better appreciates Paul Hebron's perspective.
</p>

<h2>Verses To Read</h2>

<p>
	It's kind of  hard to pick verses because "once you see it [two house] you can't un-see it".

<h1>Older Notes</h1>


<h2>Notes from Tuesday March 20, 2018</h2>

<h4>Terms: Jew, Israel, Church and Replacement Theology</h4>
<p>
	This was part of the discussion from last Shabbat (Saturday March 17, 2018) that I wanted to discuss.
	I felt it was a good example of some Critical Thinking points I mentioned ... <b><i>exegesis</i> v. <i>eisegesis</i></b>
	and also 	using <b>well defined terms</b>.
</p>
 excerpt starting at <a href="https://youtu.be/bSYC5fIHIdc?t=43m57s" target="_blank"><b>43:47</b> </a><i class="fa fa-youtube"></i>.

<br />...
<br /> <small>Joe: </small>
43:58	This is what got the <b>Jews</b>	got in trouble from the very
<br />	44:00	beginning because they denied the Torah
<br />	44:03	and [you] used the term [long / while] ago
<br />	44:06	<b>replacement theology</b> which is where
<br />	44:09	because of <b>Israel's</b> not being obedient
<br />	44:14	to the Lord, God has taken away their
<br />	44:17	blessings and put it to the <b>church</b> what
<br />	44:19	makes the church Israel

<br />
<br /> <small>Me: </small>
		44:23	Who is Israel? that you're saying this word Israel is
<br />	44:25	it talking about Jews [or] are you talking about
<br />	44:27	the <b>House of Israel</b> are you talking
<br />	44:29	about both <b>all house</b>

<br />
<br /> <small>Joe: </small>
<br />	44:33	I'm talking about ones that God through Moses told them to
<br />	44:36	do this and do that and do something
<br />	44:38	else and because they were a disobedient
<br />	44:41	to God, God...
<br />	44:45 the <b>reform group</b> and the <b>dispensationalist</b>
<br />	44:48 say that God has taken away
<br />	44:51 <b>Israel's</b> or <b>the Jews</b> blessings and put
<br />	44:55 that blessings on to the <b>church</b> [well]
<br />	44:58 makes Israel

<br />
<br /> <small>Me (interrupting): </small>
<br />	45:01 your ... we have to define our
<br />	45:04 terms now. right? you threw the word Jew
<br />	45:06 and Israel in there you know well under
<br />	45:08 changeable terms and then there's this
<br />	45:09 new term called the church oh I I agree
<br />	45:13 that that I won't deny that the Jews
<br />	45:16 were punished but I would say it's
<br />	45:18 because they did not recognize the
<br />	45:21 Covenant through the Messiah they didn't
<br />	45:25 recognize that the Covenant was now
<br />	45:27 available to Israel to all of Israel to
<br />	45:30 the house of Israel does that make sense


<h4>Initial Thoughts</h4>
<p>
	@* Before I talk about <b>Two House</b> I need to "throw out there" some basic thoughts and questions and then *@
	To give context to the <b>Two House</b> understanding I need to "throw out there" some basic thoughts and questions to chew on.
	In my presentation I want you to not focus to much on these things initially (as there are a lot of them) but let them whet your appetite,
	then, after discussing the topic come back and try to find relevance.
</p>


<h4>Goals and Mission Statement</h4>
<p>
	How can you be successful at anything that your serious about if you don't have a goal?
	For example, one of my big goals is to create and live in what I call a <b>Torah Gated Community</b>.
	Great! Once that is stated, now you can actually go about accomplishing those goals?
</p>

@*<ul>
		<li>To not only make it into the Kingdom of Heaven but be called great when I get there</li>
		<li>Fix this world according to the Kingdom of God</li>
	</ul>*@

<h4>More Topics</h4>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Attitude
			<ul>
				<li>Does God need to micromanage you?</li>
				<li>Are you waiting for the second coming to solve your problems that the <i>first coming</i> enabled you to solve yourself?</li>
				<li>Do you have a pathetic attitude masking as being humble?</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>
			Practicality
			<ul>
				<li><i>Sh'ma</i>: We definitely have to hear the word of God, but the emphasis of this Hebraic concept is <b>doing</b> what the word says.</li>
				<li>
					Weightier Matters and Time Management: Those that weigh more demand more time and sacrifices
				</li>
			</ul>

		</li>
		<li>
			Fear Ranking
			<ul>
				<li>Motivation</li>
				<li>It's a given in life you will experience fear as it's a great motivator, the question becomes how do you choice which fear (motivation) to follow</li>
				<li>
					Training: with this reality of life, it would behoove you to train appropriately.
					Make it easy for the <i>Hounds of Heaven</i> to chase you down and give you blessings.  May you be well trained to habitually <i>fall into pits of success</i>.
				</li>
			</ul>


		<li>
			Critical Thinking Development
			<ul>
				<li>Show <b>yourself</b> approved</li>
				<li><i>exegesis</i> v. <i>eisegesis</i></li>
				<li>Context / Timeline</li>
				<li>Well defined terms</li>
				<li>Authority and <i>Sola Scriptura</i></li>
				<li>Be great at asking good relevant questions</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	This is not an exhaustive list and they are also <i>cross cutting concerns</i> that can apply to many other aspects of your life (e.g. time management).
	Having said that though they should definitely not be ignored in this utmost important thing that defines your relationship with your Elohim.
</p>

<h2>Two House</h2>
<h4>Why Study Two House?</h4>
<p>
	It's amazing how much the main religions, (Antinomian) Christianity and (Rabbinic) Judaism, have ignored this teaching and understanding.
	You would think that Messianic Judaism would be interested in this but, it is my observation, they hate this topic.  It's taboo to them.
</p>


<p>
	<b>Our Era</b>
	<br />It's also amazing how much the institutions that we rely have been greatly diminished.  Here's a list
	<ul class="list-inline">
		<li>&middot; Legal</li>
		<li>&middot; Education</li>
		<li>&middot; Religion</li>
		<li>&middot; Political</li>
	</ul>
	@*Basic industries as well like agriculture.*@
	<br />What's my point?  I could spend a lot of time talking about each one of this institutions but there's not enough time.
	What I do know is that your relationship with Adonai is paramount in the era we live in and getting a good handle on Two House will help you immensely.
</p>

<h4>Salvation <small>what, who and why</small></h4>
<p>
	I admit that people's views on this are pretty much set in stone, but it needs to be reviewed.
	Christianity talks obsesseively about salvation so let me ask some questions<br />
	saved...
	<sup>
		@*<a href="https://www.myhebrewbible.com/Article/???" title="Salvation-Theology-of-Antinomian-Christianity-A-Critique, article #2"> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt-square"></i></a>*@
	</sup>
	<ul>
		<li>From <b>what</b>?</li>
		<li>to <b>whom</b> [does it apply]</li>
		<li><b>why </b>for what [purpose]</li>
	</ul>
	When answering these questions I submit it's very important to consider this from the perspective of the two houses.
	@* Original-Sin Article #713 *@
</p>

<h4>Theology and Covenants</h4>

<ul>
	<li>How complicated does Theology have to be?</li>
	<li>Has the two religions of Christianity and Judaism along with their respective theologies over complicated are relationship with our heavenly father?</li>
	<li>If your relationship with your heavenly father is based on a covenant then does that bring great clarity?</li>
</ul>


<p>
	If I want to be more definitive about Two House, I say <b>Two House <u>One Covenant</u></b>.
	Awareness of your Identity leads you to the awareness of your covenant.
